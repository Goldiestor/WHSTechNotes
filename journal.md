I feel like their should be a website on all the slang words, the benefits of having these languages in educational apps is so people can stay up to date on some words and don't have to ask their grandkids on what these word means.

I feel like schools shouldn't teach kids these languages because slang language is mostly used to talk to their friends and not adults, misunderstandings of slang might be a problem for some adults because they may never know what they are talking about.

i don't believe such bans are beneficial because what if people need to go onto the internet and research something but it is restricted, the students might feel sad about not being able to be on their phone and they will pay less attention in class.

i wouldn't mind because i have a flipphone so i'm basically limited to texting, so i would be okay with the restrictions.
